You might have assumed, like I did, that the figures provided in ACT geometry problems are not drawn to scale. However, after taking many ACT tests for practice, I noticed that I had yet to come across a single figure that wasn't drawn to scale. I searched around to see if anyone else had noticed this, and found that Mike Barrett, the very well-known author of _The ACT Black Book_, said that he had not seen any figures on the ACT that were not drawn to scale.

This isn't the most helpful tip, since, generally, the ACT gives answer choices that are fairly close together numerically, making it difficult to estimate the answer. However, if you are running out of time and need to make a quick guess, this can certainly be a useful tip that will allows you to eliminate some answer choices to get a higher chance at guessing correctly. 

Take for example this question:

<figure>
    <a href="https://github.com/36ACT/MyPicture/blob/master/geometry/body_planegeo.jpg?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/36ACT/MyPicture/blob/master/geometry/body_planegeo.jpg?raw=true"></a>
</figure>

Those that are fairly familiar with angles can easily see that angle RPS (which corresponds with arc RS) is greater than 45 degrees, but less than 90 degrees, meaning that H is the only logical option (and the correct one). 

On a side note, "Cannot be determined from the given information" is pretty much never the correct answer, and generally serves as a trap for people who don't know how to solve the problem. In all the tests I've taken, I don't recall ever coming across a question where the answer could not be determined from the given information. Forthat reason, I can safely assume that the answer is H without having to consider K as a possible answer choice.
