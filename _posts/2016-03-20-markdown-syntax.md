You might have assume, like I did, that the figures provided in ACT geometry problems are not drawn to scale. However, after taking many ACT tests for practice, I noticed that I had yet to come across a single figure that wasn't drawn to scale, I searched around to see if anyone else had noticed this, and found that Mike Barrett, the very well-known author of _The ACT Black Book_, said that he had not seen any figures on the ACT that were not drawn to scale.

This isn't the most helpful tip, since, generally, the ACT gives answer choices that are fairly close together, making it difficult to estimate the answer. However, if you are running out of time and need to make a quick guess, this can certainly be a useful tip.

Take for example this question:

{% capture images %}
	https://github.com/36ACT/MyPicture/blob/master/geometry/body_planegeo.jpg?raw=true
{% endcapture %}

For those of you that are familiar with angles, you can easily see that âˆ RPS (which corresponds with arc RS) is greater than 45 degrees, but less than 90 degrees, allowing you to correctly guess that the answer is 60 degrees.
